<h1>Excel-Analysis--Kickstarted-Campaigns</h1>

<p align="justify">Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.</p>
<p align="justify">Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.</p>

<h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>

<p align="justify">The mean in successful outcome analysis is 194 and the median is 62, the alarming gap between them is related to the elevated amount outliers.
In this scenario, the minimum number of backers is 1, the maximum is 26,457 and the upper bound is 259.50. In consequence, 305 backers are over the latter ensuring the number of outliers.</p>

<p align="justify">On the other hand, the mean in failed outcome is 18 and the median is 4. The difference is not as significant as the successful outcome, however, the minimum number is 0 and the maximum is 1293. Due to the maximum number being high, the median and mean should increase as well, however, the number of low backers is considered excessive and the upper bound is 24. Therefore, this displays that those high outliers do not have much impact on the median.</p>

<p align="justify">In both cases, the mean is affected for outliers which makes the distribution of both data spread. In comparison to the mean, the median offers a better approach to summarizing the data more meaningfully.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<ul><br>
<li>Live campaigns only have information from 2017 which can not be compared properly in the Date Created graph.</li><br>
<li>The sub-category “plays” is the most successful, at the same time, it had the most failure or canceled.</li>
